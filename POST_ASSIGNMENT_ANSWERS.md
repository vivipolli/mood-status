- **Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them**  
I chose to use Nest and Prisma to compose the backend architecture because besides being technologies that are starting to be more used with Node, I don't need to worry too much about creating endpoints and integrating with the database. Nest is a good framework that avoids messy folder structuring.
I chose to initialize the app when there is no record with a default mood and force the user to register their first mood instead of initializing with a blank or default page.
- **How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").**
  - Understanding the requirements and defining the arquitecture: 1h30
  - Implementing the backend: 2h
  - Debugging and fixing docker issues: 4h
  - Updating the frontend: 1h30
- **If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?**   
Create the MoodType enum in lowercase.
- **Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?**  
Not much, as I ended up wasting a lot of time adapting and understanding how tools like pnpn, docker and turbo work, less so with React and typescript/javascript.
- **Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?**
Yes, my abilities to create more complex algorithm functions and also responsiveness.
