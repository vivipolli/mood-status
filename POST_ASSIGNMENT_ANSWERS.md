- **Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them**    
I chose Nest and Prisma for the backend architecture because they are increasingly popular with Node.js 
and simplify endpoint creation and database integration. Nest provides a clean and organized framework, preventing messy folder structures.
  For the application initialization, I opted to start with a default mood record rather than a blank or 
default page. This approach encourages users to register their first mood, providing immediate engagement and a more personalized experience.


- **How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").**
  - Understanding the requirements and defining the arquitecture: 1h30
  - Updating the frontend: 1h30
  - Implementing the backend: 2h
  - Debugging and fixing docker issues: 5h
  - Refactoting and frontend improvements: 3h


- **If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?**   
To implement the lint in the web repo. 


- **Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?**  
Not much, as I ended up wasting a lot of time adapting and understanding how tools like docker, prisma and turbo work together, less so with React and typescript/javascript.


- **Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?**
Yes, my abilities to create more complex algorithm functions and also responsiveness on the frontend.
