- **What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?**  
I did not understand this question.
- **What changes/additions would you make to the design?**
  - I would add a default page for when the user doesn't have any moods already registered and I would also add screens for smaller devices.
  - Rather than `current mode`, I'll suggest mentioning the last mood, because when loading the page the user will see the last mood logged and not the current. 
- **List two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.**
  - Authentication features
  - A description box for the user to say how they feel in more detail.
  - If the user responds that they are sad, add sources about tips and studies on what they can do to feel better.
- **Are there any clarifying questions you would ask? If you're able to make assumptions about these and continue, please record and share your assumptions.**
Yes, about the home page, when the user has nothing registered, in this case I assumed that he had at least one mood registered to load the page for the first time.
